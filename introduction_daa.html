        <h1>Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

        <h2>What is the course about?</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</strong> course delves into the world of algorithms, 
            showcasing how different data structures are used to solve real-world problems. 
            Students learn to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the purpose and functionality of algorithms.</li>
            <li>Analyze their time and space complexity for performance evaluation.</li>
            <li>Implement algorithms in practical applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The course highlights how the development of one algorithm often inspires the creation of others, 
            emphasizing continuous improvement. It also explores the transformative impact of algorithms on 
            technology and society.
        </p>

        <h2>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h2>
        <p>The course covers a wide array of data structures and algorithms:</p>
        <h3>Data Structures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trees:</strong> Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees</li>
            <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Tries for efficient string storage and search</li>
            <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> BFS (queue-based), DFS (stack-based)</li>
            <li><strong>Range Queries:</strong> Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort</li>
            <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Dijkstra's Algorithm, Floyd's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm</li>
            <li><strong>String Matching:</strong> Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How do you connect the course with real-time applications?</h2>
        daa is a course which is based on real time applications only.how dijistrea came up with the idea to find the 
shortest path to his home while having a cup of cofee with his finace and how boyer moore came up with the algoritm
to lay down electric lines to every house.the way in which the jal jeevan mission is being implemented this showcases
how algorithms are all around us.
       
        <p>
            These examples illustrate how algorithms are integral to solving challenges in transportation, 
            infrastructure, and technology, among others.
